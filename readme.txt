== Description ==

Extends Jigoshop to allow you to add a YouTube Video to the Product page. An additional tab is added on the single products page to allow your customers to view the YouTube video you added.

When adding a product select the "YouTube Video" tab and insert your video url where asked. A new tab will appear on the product page called "YouTube Video" (or the title you entered for the video) and your YouTube video will then display.

You can also use the JWPlayer instead of YouTube default video player. If you have the JWPlayer for WordPress plugin installed and activated and you have a license, you can select one of the 8 premium skins to customise the player. You can also upload your own skin to use.

Jigoshop YouTube Video Product Tab works with any theme that supports Jigoshop. It also uses JWPlayer v6.2

The manual installation method involves downloading my plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application.

1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation's wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
